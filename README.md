# Event Management System - Frontend

This repository contains the frontend of an **Event Management System** that allows users to manage their events, invite others to events, and track the status of invitations. The application is built with **React** and communicates with the backend API to perform CRUD operations.

## Brief Overview

The **Event Management System** frontend provides users with the following features:
- User registration and login.
- Event creation and management.
- Tracking sent and received invitations.
- RSVP to event invitations.

## Application Structure

The frontend of the system is structured around several pages and components, each serving a specific role in the user's experience:

### Pages:

   - Provides options for **Login** and **Registration**.
   - Routes:
     - `/`: The **Landing Page** where users can log in or register.

     - The navigation bar includes a link to the Home Page where the user can see their events.
   
3. **Invitations Page**:
   - Displays events the user has been invited to (received invites) and events the user has sent invites to (sent invites).
   - Users can RSVP to event invitations.
   - Routes:
     - `/invitations`: The **Invitations Page** where users can track their received and sent invitations, and accept or decline invites.

4. **404 Error Page**:
   - Any unimplemented routes will lead to a **404 Error Page**.
   - Routes:
     - `/404`: This page will be displayed for any undefined routes.

### Other Links in the Navbar:
